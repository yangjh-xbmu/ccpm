# Epic: Implement Simple Flask App

## 1. Technical Approach

- **Framework**: Python 3 with Flask.
- **Structure**: A single `app.py` file will contain the application logic.
- **Dependencies**: A `requirements.txt` file will list all necessary packages (i.e., Flask).
- **Execution**: The application will be run using the `flask run` command.

## 2. Implementation Plan

This epic will be broken down into the following tasks:

- **Task 1**: Create the basic project structure, including the `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files.
- **Task 2**: Implement the Flask application logic to return "Hello, World!" at the root URL.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- The project structure is correctly created in the `sample-project/` directory.
- The application runs successfully via `flask run` after installing dependencies.
- Accessing `http://127.0.0.1:5000` shows the "Hello, World!" message.
